We strongly recommend that you modify IP address of the local gateway to avoid IP address conflicts with the center of the AP. (ex. if IP address of AP is 192.168.1.1, you can modify IP address of the local gateway to 192.168.1.2).@#$
LAN IP address or Netmask change will result in failure of accessing to this Router@#$
You should release and renew PC's IP address for the succedent configuraion.@#$
Are you sure you want to change the LAN IP address or Netmask?@#$
