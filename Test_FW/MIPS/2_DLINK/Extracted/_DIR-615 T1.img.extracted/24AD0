The amount of time that a computer may have an IP address before it is required to renew the lease. The lease functions just as a lease on an apartment would. The initial lease designates the amount of time before the lease expires. If the tenant wishes to retain the address when the lease is expired then a new lease is established. If the lease expires and the address is no longer needed then another tenant may use the address.@#$
These two values (from and to) define a range of IP addresses that the DHCP Server uses when assigning addresses to computers and devices on your Local Area Network. Any addresses that are outside of this range are not managed by the DHCP Server; these could, therefore, be used for manually configured devices or devices that cannot use DHCP to obtain network address details automatically.@#$
Your router uses 192.168.11.1 for the IP address. You've assigned a computer that you want to designate as a Web server with a static IP address of 192.168.11.3. You've assigned another computer that you want to designate as an FTP server with a static IP address of 192.168.11.4. Therefore the starting IP address for your DHCP IP address range needs to be 192.168.11.5 or greater.@#$
Your router uses 192.168.0.1 for the IP address. You've assigned a computer that you want to designate as a Web server with a static IP address of 192.168.0.3. You've assigned another computer that you want to designate as an FTP server with a static IP address of 192.168.0.4. Therefore the starting IP address for your DHCP IP address range needs to be 192.168.0.5 or greater.@#$
There are several connection types to choose from: Link-local, Static IP v6, DHCPv6, Stateless Autoconfiguration, PPPoE, IPv6 in IPv4 Tunnel and 6to4. If you are unsure of your connection method, please contact your IPv6 Internet Service Provider. Note: If using the PPPoE option, you will need to ensure that any PPPoE client software on your computers is removed or disabled.@#$
define a range of IP addresses that the DHCP Server uses when assigning addresses to computers and devices on your Local Area Network. Any addresses that are outside of this range are not managed by the DHCP Server; these could, therefore, be used for manually configured devices or devices that cannot use DHCP to obtain network address details automatically.@#$
Used when your ISP provides you a set IPv6 address that does not change. The IPv6 information is manually entered in your IPv6 configuration settings. You must enter the IPv6 address, Subnet Prefix Length, Default Gateway, Primary DNS Server, and Secondary DNS Server. Your ISP provides you with all of this information.@#$
Suppose you configure the DHCP Server to manage addresses From 192.168.11.100 To 192.168.11.199. This means that 192.168.11.3 to 192.168.11.99 and 192.168.11.200 to 192.168.11.254 are NOT managed by the DHCP Server. Computers or devices that use addresses from these ranges are to be manually configured.@#$
Suppose you configure the DHCP Server to manage addresses From 192.168.0.100 To 192.168.0.199. This means that 192.168.0.3 to 192.168.0.99 and 192.168.0.200 to 192.168.0.254 are NOT managed by the DHCP Server. Computers or devices that use addresses from these ranges are to be manually configured.@#$
The router's local network (LAN) settings are configured based on the IP Address and Subnet Mask assigned in this section. The IP address is also used to access this Web-based management interface. It is recommended that you use the default settings if you do not have an existing network.@#$
Once your D-Link router is properly configured and this option is enabled, the router will manage the IPv6 addresses and other network configuration information for computers and other devices connected to your Local Area Network. There is no need for you to do this yourself.@#$
Once your router is properly configured and DHCP Server is enabled, the DHCP Server will manage the IP addresses and other network configuration information for computers and other devices connected to your Local Area Network. There is no need for you to do this yourself.@#$
These are the settings of the LAN (Local Area Network) IPv6 interface for the router. The router's LAN IPv6 Address is configured based on the IPv6 Address and Subnet assigned by your ISP. (A subnet with prefix /64 is supported in LAN.)@#$
A method of connection where the ISP assigns your IPv6 address when your router requests one from the ISP's server. Some ISP's require you to make some settings on your side before your router can connect to the IPv6 Internet.@#$
DHCP stands for Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol. The DHCP section is where you configure the built-in DHCP Server to assign IP addresses to the computers and other devices on your local area network (LAN).@#$
Link-local address is used by nodes and routers when communicating with neighboring nodes on the same link. This mode enables IPv6-capable devices to communicate with each other in the LAN side.@#$
This method of connection requires you to enter a <strong>Username</strong> and <strong>Password</strong> (provided by your Internet Service Provider) to gain access to the IPv6 Internet.@#$
Your router, by default, has a static IP address of 192.168.11.1. This means that addresses 192.168.11.2 to 192.168.11.254 can be made available for allocation by the DHCP Server.@#$
Use this section to setup IPv6 Autoconfiguration to assign IPv6 address to the computers on your local network. A Stateless and a Stateful Autoconfiguration method are provided.@#$
Your router, by default, has a static IP address of 192.168.0.1. This means that addresses 192.168.0.2 to 192.168.0.254 can be made available for allocation by the DHCP Server.@#$
6to4 is an IPv6 address assignment and automatic tunneling technology that used to provide unicast IPv6 connectivity between IPv6 sites and hosts across the IPv4 Internet.@#$
Select this option if your ISP requires you to use a PPPoE (Point to Point Protocol over Ethernet) connection to IPv6 Internet. DSL providers typically use this option.@#$
The computers (and other devices) connected to your LAN also need to have their TCP/IP configuration set to "DHCPv6" or "Obtain an IPv6 address automatically".@#$

For example, if a gaming application sends outgoing data on ports 5000-6000 but receives the incoming data on port 111, typically behind a NAT router the router simply drops the data because it does not know which computer it should send requests to. But with port triggering you can tell the router to allow incoming data on port 111 when an outgoing data sends it through ports 5000-6000. It gives more flexibility than static port forwarding because you don't need to set it up for a specific computer.@#$
You can prevent certain local IP accessing Internet with IP port filter and block accessing to certain Internet services. For example, select protocol as "IP", rule action as "Deny", direction as "Downstream" and fill the IP/IP mask, that means downstream IP packets matching the source IP address and the destination IP address can not enter the internal network.@#$
Dynamic DNS: The host without a fixed IP can change the relationship between DNS and IP using a dynamic DNS service if the IP changes. You can configure dynamic DNS for DynDNS.org, TZO or Oray. You can add/delete a dynamic DNS. The account provided by DDNS service providers.@#$
UPnP is short for Universal Plug and Play, which is a networking architecture that provides compatibility among networking equipment, software, and peripherals. This router has optional UPnP capability, and can work with other UPnP devices and software.@#$
Traffic control is a pro-active measures to adjust the output rate of flow. The role is to limit the outflow of a network traffic of a connection with sudden, so that such packets to send out a uniform rate. You can add traffic shaping rules.@#$
If any other ingress rule is in place, that will be used instead of sending packets to the DMZ host; so, an active session, virtual server, active port trigger, or port forwarding rule will take priority over sending a packet to the DMZ host.@#$
Port Triggering is a special form of Port Forwarding in which it requires an outgoing connection before allowing incoming connections on a single or multiple port. Port Triggering is mostly used when your computer is behind a NAT router.@#$
If this computer obtains its address Automatically using DHCP, then you may want to make a static reservation on the Basic Network Settings page so that the IP address of the DMZ computer does not change.@#$
Telnet is a network protocol used on the Internet or local area networks to provide a bidirectional interactive text-oriented communication facility using a virtual terminal connection.@#$
DMZ means "Demilitarized Zone." If an application has trouble working from behind the router, you can expose one computer to the Internet and run the application on that computer.@#$
Used to configure the keyword filter. You can add or remove keywords to filter. This feature can prevent LAN users to access the website with specific keywords.@#$
You can Specify what kind of service should be enabled in WAN on this page. Packets available in the ACL list or from IP specified can enter the AP Router.@#$
When a LAN host is configured as a DMZ host, it becomes the destination for all incoming packets that do not match some other incoming session or rule.@#$
Putting a computer in the DMZ may expose that computer to a variety of security risks. Use of this option is only recommended as a last resort.@#$
You can create name for each rule and control the flow direction. You can either allow or deny a set of IP address,protocols and port ranges.@#$

The router monitors outgoing traffic. When the router detects a specific outgoing traffic it will remember the IP address of the computer that send data and the input port of the 'trigger'.The trigger input port on the flow of information is then sent to trigger the computer. Applications from Internet can access to the local computer through Port Mapping/Port Triggering so lan hosts can provide service such as ftp http games and so on. Once the port trigger is enabled the requests from the Internet will be sent to the appropriate server in LAN@#$
