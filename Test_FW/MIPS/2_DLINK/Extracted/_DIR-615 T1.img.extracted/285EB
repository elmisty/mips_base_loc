The Easy Setup supports three popular types of connection. To make sure the connection type your ISP provides, please refer to the ISP.@#$
Dynamic IP - Usually for Cable Modem and the router will automatically obtain an IP address from the DHCP server@#$
Static IP - This type of connection uses a permanent, fixed (static) IP address that your ISP assigned.@#$
PPPoE - Usually for ADSL Modem and you will need a PPPoE username and password from your ISP@#$
